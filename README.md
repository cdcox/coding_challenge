# Problem

Two problems were addressed:

The first was a poker hand calculator. This takes in a list of 10 card hands splits in half and finds which player won each hand. This largely involved building a label for each hand then ranking the label, comparing, and determining which hand won by relevant high cards. 

The next was adding every even fibonacci number under 4 million, this was done by building a fibonacci sequence calcaultor and adding any number that was 0 when modulo 2 to find even values.
