# Usage

Each solution can be imported as poker_hand_problem and fib_problem. Running the main function will also print out the answer values.


# Problem

Two problems (#1 and 6) were addressed:

The first was a poker hand calculator(#1). This takes in a list of 10 card hands splits in half and finds which player won each hand. This largely involved building a label for each hand then ranking the label, comparing, and determining which hand won by relevant high cards. 

The next problem (#6) colved was adding every even Fibonacci number under 4 million. This was done by building a Fibonacci calcaultor then adding any number that was 0 when modulo 2 to find even values.
